Plant Disease Detection and Classification
Overview
This project aims to detect and classify plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It takes an image of a plant leaf as input, processes it using a trained model, and predicts the disease category. The system provides insights on the disease, its causes, and possible treatments.
