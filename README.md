Agriculture plays a crucial role in global food production, but plant diseases pose a significant threat to crop yield and quality. Early and accurate detection of plant diseases is essential for taking timely preventive measures.

This project, Plant Disease Detection and Classification, is an AI-powered system that identifies diseases in plants based on leaf images. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model can classify multiple plant diseases with high accuracy.

The system takes an image of a plant leaf as input and processes it through a deep learning model trained on the PlantVillage dataset. It then predicts the disease category and provides valuable insights, such as:
Disease Name
Causes of the Disease
Treatment Suggestions (Pesticides, Organic Remedies, Prevention Techniques)

Why is this Important?
Reduces Crop Loss – Early detection helps in quick treatment, preventing widespread damage.
Minimizes Chemical Use – Suggests optimal pesticide use, promoting sustainable farming.
Affordable & Scalable – A cost-effective solution accessible via a mobile or web application.
Enhances Productivity – Supports farmers in improving crop health and yield.
