# Plant-disease-detection-and-classification-using-cnn
Overview:
This project aims to detect and classify plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It takes an image of a plant leaf as input, processes it using a trained model, and predicts the disease category. The system provides insights on the disease, its causes, and possible treatments.
Features:
Image-based Disease Detection – Upload an image of a plant leaf to detect the disease.
Deep Learning Model – Uses a custom CNN model (PyTorch) for classification.
Multi-class Classification – Detects and classifies multiple plant diseases.
Treatment Suggestions – Provides disease descriptions and treatment recommendations.
High Accuracy – Trained on the PlantVillage dataset for robust performance.
